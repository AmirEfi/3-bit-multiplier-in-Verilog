# 3-bit-multiplier-in-Verilog
## Simple 3-bit multiplier 

This is one of my HWs in Digital Logic course that we have to design and implement a 3-bit multiplier.

You can find the code in Verilog in gate-level form.

Also in this [link](https://circuitverse.org/users/109689/projects/digital-logic-problem-set-6) you can see the gate scheme.
